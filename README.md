# DC-Motor-Control-PID-vs-Fuzzy-vs-OpenLoop
This Simulink model controls a DC motor using open-loop, PID, and fuzzy logic controllers. It compares their performance in terms of speed response and accuracy. The fuzzy controller shows better adaptability and smoother control. All outputs are visualized for analysis using scope and MUX blocks.
